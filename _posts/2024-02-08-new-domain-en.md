So I just spent 35RMB (~5$) to buy a domain for myself: `robomico.cn`. This blog site is now accessible via the subdomain [blog.robomico.cn](https://blog.robomico.cn)!

Content of the blog is still hosted on GitHub Pages ~~and the original domain [robomico.github.io](https://robomico.github.io) is still available.~~ (UPD: I was wrong. The content on the original url won't update anymore.)

If I decide to tinker any random things in the future, I would also attach them to my new domain.

**For International Readers:** I don't know whether the `.cn` domain is accessible outside China. If it is restricted and you have difficulty accessing the new domain, please let me know.

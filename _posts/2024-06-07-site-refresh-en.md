After a short period of shutdown, my website is now reborn with an improved design, more integrated content, and a new URL! ~~Yes I finished all the work in one and a half day.~~

Now the `blog` subdomain is removed and you can access here through `https://robomico.cn`, since the new site is more than simply a blog, but also my homepage and a place for displaying my works and content related to me.

You may find the UI design similar but different to before. I still used Jekyll and Chirpy theme to build the site but with _a tiny little modifications_, e.g. removed sidebar (now it's used as a menu in mobile version), extended topbar, added a new language switching button, etc. The old blog posts are still here, and the blog is now a submodule of the whole website. One thing worth noting is that all the comments in the blog are gone, since I moved the site to another GitHub repo.

The new site is still not fully tested and I'm sure there are things that may look or behavior weird. If you encounter any, please comment below so I could check and fix them.

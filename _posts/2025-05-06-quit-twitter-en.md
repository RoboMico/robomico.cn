My twitter account has been taking up a considerable amount of my time as I have been trying to get rid of meaningless socializing. Plus, from an objective perspective, maintaining my twitter for activeness is quite worthless, both in short-term(I'm already occupied for the coming important exam) and long-term(a nice-looking twitter profile just doesn't add much value to myself, as far as I'm concerned). Also, feed from twitter are flooded with useless and sometimes even harmful information, which has already had an impact on my life quality.

Therefore, I decide to deactivate my twitter account, and it will be permanently deleted from the Internet 30 days later. Remaining of my main social accounts are Bilibili and Discord, and you can always reach out to me via email (almost) anytime.

In the future I might create a new private twitter account, specifically for business purposes(like commissions and other stuff). I do not wish to create accounts on other social networks such as Weibo or Bluesky either.
